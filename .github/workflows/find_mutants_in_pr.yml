# An example of how to run cargo-mutants on only the sections of code that have changed in a pull request,
# using the `--in-diff` feature of cargo-mutants.
#
# This can give much faster feedback on pull requests, but can miss some problems that
# would be found by running mutants on the whole codebase.
